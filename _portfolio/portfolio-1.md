I worked in a team with 3 other people to create a mock theme park management system in my database systems course. We used MySQL and Express.js in order to create a user-friendly and powerful web-application for both users and employees alike.
The project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/TacoJGriz/theme-park-managment)

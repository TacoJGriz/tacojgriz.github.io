This is my personal website, Here I will share career updates, along with other things I work on or find interesting.
## About Me
Hello!! My name is Jackson, I am a 20 year old computer science student. I grew up in Austin, Texas but I am current studying at the University of Houston in Houston Texas. Ever since I was a kid, I've had a passion for coding and anything involving computers. I grew up tinkering with whatever electronics I could get my hands on and learning my way around a keyboard. I have a passion for learning new things, and even though I've primarily focused on software engineering, I also have a knack for data science and cybersecurity. Some of my other areas of interest are 3D modeling in blender and working in Linux. If you want to see some projects I've worked on over the years, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/tacojgriz) or my [Portfolio](/portfolio).

## Interests
Whenever I am not studying or coding, some of my favorite things are disc golf, hiking, hanging out with my family or friends, traveling, drawing, and more. I love music, I am currently a saxophonist in the Spirit of Houston, and I also play the guitar and bass. Whenever I am not playing an instument I am usually listening to music. I also love food.
